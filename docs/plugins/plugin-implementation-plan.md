# ðŸ”Œ Plugin System Implementation Plan

> **Note**: This implementation plan has been reorganized into focused documents for better navigation and implementation. See the overview document for the complete structure.

## ðŸ“‹ Document Structure

The plugin system implementation has been divided into manageable phases:

### ðŸ“– [Plugin Implementation Overview](./plugin-implementation-overview.md)
**Purpose**: Coordination document with strategy and cross-phase considerations
**Use**: Start here for implementation planning and progress tracking

### ðŸ“– [Phase 1: Foundation](./plugin-implementation-phase1-foundation.md) 
**Phases 1-3**: Core infrastructure and basic plugin loading
- TypeScript interfaces and type system
- Plugin directory structure and file management  
- Manifest loading and validation
- Basic plugin registry and command registration

### ðŸ“– [Phase 2: Core Features](./plugin-implementation-phase2-core.md)
**Phases 4-6**: Working plugins and developer experience
- UI components and basic actions
- Bundled application launcher plugin (critical validation)
- Hot reload and development tools

### ðŸ“– [Phase 3: Advanced Features](./plugin-implementation-phase3-advanced.md)
**Phases 7-10**: Production readiness and user experience
- Permission system and security
- Search integration and dynamic commands
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Begin with**: [Phase 1: Foundation](./plugin-implementation-phase1-foundation.md)
2. **Critical validation**: Phase 2 bundled application launcher plugin
3. **Production ready**: Complete Phase 3 advanced features

## ðŸ“‹ Success Criteria Summary

- **Foundation Complete**: Can load and register basic plugins
- **Core Complete**: Application launcher works as plugin  
- **Advanced Complete**: Production-ready with security and docs

Each phase builds upon the previous and produces testable increments. The bundled application launcher plugin serves as the critical validation point for the entire architecture.
