# Keyed Launcher - Project Overview

## üéØ Vision

Create the gold standard for application launchers - a high-performance, multiplatform launcher that rivals and exceeds existing solutions like Spotlight, Raycast, and Rofi. The goal is to build a performant, batteries-included, customizable and extensible open source launcher with a viable business model.

## ÔøΩ Market Opportunity

**Problem**: Current launcher solutions are fragmented across platforms, often slow, or lack extensibility. Linux users especially rely on aging solutions like Rofi, while proprietary options like Raycast are limited to specific platforms.

**Solution**: A unified, open source launcher that works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux, offering both simplicity for casual users and deep customization for power users.

**Target Users**:

- **Developers**: Need fast, keyboard-driven productivity tools
- **Power Users**: Want customization and extensibility
- **Linux Enthusiasts**: Seeking modern alternatives to traditional tools
- **Cross-platform Users**: Need consistent experience across operating systems

## ÔøΩ Business Model

**Open Source Foundation**: Core launcher remains free and open source to drive adoption and community contribution.

**Sustainable Revenue Streams**:

- Premium features and plugins
- Enterprise licensing and support
- Cloud sync and backup services
- Professional customization services

## üé™ Technology Foundation

**Built with**: Tauri (Rust + TypeScript) for optimal performance and small footprint
**Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
**Philosophy**: Performance-first architecture with sub-100ms startup times

## üèÜ Success Criteria

- **Performance**: Fastest launcher in its class (< 100ms startup)
- **Adoption**: Become the preferred choice for developers and power users
- **Community**: Active open source ecosystem with plugins and contributions
- **Revenue**: Sustainable business model supporting continued development
- **Market Position**: Recognition as the gold standard for application launchers

This project aims to fill the gap in the market for a truly universal, high-performance launcher while building a sustainable business around open source software.
