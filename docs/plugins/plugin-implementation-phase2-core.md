# 🔌 Plugin System Implementation - Phase 2: Core Features

## 📋 Overview

This document covers phases 4-6 of the plugin system implementation. These phases build upon the foundation to create working plugins with UI components, example implementations, and developer experience features.

**Goal**: Transform the plugin foundation into a functional system with real plugins and development tools.

## 🎯 Phase 4: Basic UI Components & Actions

### Step 4.1: Essential UI Components ✅ COMPLETED
**Artifact**: Basic plugin UI component library
**Testing**: Render test components in plugin environment

1. ✅ Create `src/plugins/components/index.tsx`:
   - ✅ Export basic `List` and `ListItem` components
   - ✅ Export `Detail` component for simple views
   - ✅ Wrapper components that work in plugin context

2. ⚠️ Test component integration:
   - ✅ React components created with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ⚠️ Minor TypeScript config issues with Tauri types
   - ✅ Component structure supports plugin isolation

### Step 4.2: Basic Actions ✅ COMPLETED
**Artifact**: Essential action implementations
**Testing**: Execute actions and verify behavior

1. ✅ Create `src/plugins/actions/index.ts`:
   - ✅ `Action.OpenInBrowser(url: string)`
   - ✅ `Action.CopyToClipboard(text: string)`
   - ✅ `Action.Close()` - return to command palette
   - ✅ Basic error handling and user feedback

2. ✅ Implement action execution:
   - ✅ Tauri commands for system actions (added shell & clipboard plugins)
   - ✅ Action result handling (success/failure)
   - ✅ Plugin API module created with useClipboard, useEnvironment hooks

## 🎯 Phase 5: Example Plugin Development

### Step 5.1: Create Bundled Application Launcher Plugin
**Artifact**: Functional application launcher as plugin
**Testing**: Discover and launch applications through plugin system

1. Create `~/.config/keyed-launcher/plugins/bundled/app-launcher/`:
   - `manifest.json` with proper plugin metadata
   - `index.js` with plugin entry point
   - Commands for app discovery and launching

2. Implement basic app discovery:
   - Simple app detection for current platform
   - Generate launcher entries for discovered apps
   - Basic app launching via shell commands

3. Validate plugin architecture:
   - Test that built-in functionality works as plugin
   - Verify performance and user experience
   - Identify plugin system limitations

### Step 5.2: Development Plugin Template
**Artifact**: Example plugin for development
**Testing**: Load and test development plugin

1. Create example development plugin in `development/` directory:
   - Simple "Hello World" plugin with both `no-view` and `view` commands
   - Example of different command types and categories
   - Documentation for plugin developers

2. Test development workflow:
   - Manual plugin loading from development directory
   - Command registration and execution
   - Error handling for malformed plugins

## 🎯 Phase 6: File Watching & Hot Reload

### Step 6.1: Plugin File Watcher
**Artifact**: Real-time plugin reloading system
**Testing**: Modify plugins and verify automatic reload

1. Extend existing theme watcher to support plugins:
   - Watch plugin directories for changes
   - Detect new plugins, removed plugins, and modified plugins
   - Emit events for plugin changes

2. Implement hot reloading:
   - Reload plugins when files change (development mode)
   - Update command registry automatically
   - Preserve user state during reload

### Step 6.2: Development Experience
**Artifact**: Developer-friendly plugin development
**Testing**: Modify plugins and see instant results

1. Add development helpers:
   - Plugin reload command in launcher
   - Error display for plugin loading failures
   - Development mode indicators

2. Create plugin development documentation:
   - Quick start guide for plugin development
   - API reference for available components and actions
   - Example plugin code and best practices

## 📋 Success Criteria for Core Features Phases

- **Phase 4**: UI components working, basic actions functional
- **Phase 5**: Application launcher plugin working, validates entire architecture
- **Phase 6**: Hot reload enables productive development experience

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Performance Targets
- Component rendering: < 16ms (60 FPS)
- Action execution: < 50ms for system actions
- Hot reload: < 100ms for development changes
- App discovery: < 200ms for initial scan

### Development Experience
- Type-safe plugin APIs with full TypeScript support
- Instant feedback during plugin development
- Clear error messages for common mistakes
- Example plugins for every major use case

### Critical Validation Points
- **Phase 5.1** is the most important - if the app launcher plugin doesn't work well, the architecture needs adjustment
- Hot reload (Phase 6) should feel instant and not disrupt user workflow
- Error handling must be robust enough for development mistakes

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing these core feature phases, proceed to:
- **Phase 3 Document**: Advanced Features & Production Readiness
- Focus on permissions, search integration, and production polish
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

Phase 5 (Example Plugin Development) is the critical validation point. If the bundled application launcher doesn't work smoothly, revisit the architecture before proceeding to advanced features.
